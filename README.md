# Zomboid-Server-Scripts
A collection of scripts to assist in managing a Zomboid server.

The scripts used here will need tweaking for your server.

I utilized GNU Screen to handle the server instance. Cronjobs were scheduled for regular restarts and the mod update checker was reliable and lightweight. I experienced no stability issues running off of a miniPC.
